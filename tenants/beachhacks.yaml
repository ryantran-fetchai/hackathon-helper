    # BeachHacks Helper (Hackathon Q&A + Organizer Escalation)

    A hackathon support agent that answers participant questions using the event knowledge base (schedule, rules, logistics, judging, prizes, sponsors, workshops, etc.). If I can’t find a confident answer—or if something sounds urgent—I can **offer to escalate to a human organizer via Discord**.

    ---

    ## ✅ What this Agent Can Do

    - **Answer BeachHacks questions (KB-first, no guessing)**
      - Schedule: "When is the next workshop?" "When does hacking end?"
      - Rules/logistics: "Where do I submit?" "What are the team size rules?"
      - Judging/prizes/sponsors: "How does judging work?" "What prizes are available?"

    - **Handle time-sensitive schedule questions**
      - Uses the current date/time to say whether something is upcoming vs already passed.

    - **Offer organizer escalation when appropriate**
      - If the knowledge base doesn’t contain the answer
      - If you need real-time/on-the-ground info (e.g., "food still hasn’t arrived")
      - If you’re in distress or reporting something urgent (injury, harassment, safety concern, theft, lost item)

    ## 🆘 Escalation (Discord) — how it works

    - I will **ask for confirmation first** if escalation is needed.
    - If you reply with something like **"yes" / "please" / "escalate"**, I will post your message to the organizers’ Discord via webhook.
    - The Discord post will include your message plus the tenant’s configured settings:
      - `message_prefix`: `[BeachHacks Escalation] `
      - `mention_role_id`: *(not set for this tenant — no role ping)*

    ---

    ## ❌ What this Agent Will Not Do

    - Invent answers not present in the knowledge base
    - Provide general trivia or unrelated chatbot help
    - Guarantee real-time operational details without escalation
    - Replace emergency services—if someone is in immediate danger, contact onsite staff/security right away (and I can still escalate to organizers)

    ## 🗣️ Example Prompts

    | Prompt                                   | What happens |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
    | "What's the schedule for today?"         | I answer from the knowledge base |
    | "Where do I submit my project?"          | I answer from the knowledge base |
    | "Food hasn’t arrived yet"                | I’ll likely offer escalation |
    | "I lost my laptop / I feel unsafe"       | I’ll offer escalation immediately |
    | "Yes, please escalate"                   | If escalation is pending, I confirm and send |

    ## 🎯 Typical Response Format

    **Answer:**

    ```
    <A clear answer sourced from the hackathon knowledge base>
    ```

    **Escalation offer:**

    ```
    I couldn't find a confident answer to your question.
    Would you like me to escalate this to a human organizer who can help you directly?
    ```

    **After you confirm:**

    ```
    Escalation sent successfully. The organizers have been notified on Discord and will follow up shortly.
    ```

    ## 🤝 Use via ASI:One

    You can invoke this agent in ASI:One by mentioning it in your prompt:

    ```
    @<agent_address> where is check-in?
    ```

    _(Replace `<agent_address>` with this agent's address. You can find it when the agent starts or in the agent manifest.)_

    ## 🔌 How It Works (High-level)

    1. Receives your message via the Agent Chat Protocol
    2. Uses `retrieve_docs` to search the hackathon knowledge base
    3. If it can’t answer (or it’s urgent), uses `offer_escalation`
    4. If you confirm, uses `confirm_escalation` to notify organizers via Discord
